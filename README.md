         Introduction
The school performance study of students is, due to its relevance and complexity, one of the issues of major controversy in the Educational research, and it has been given special attention over the time. This study shows a conceptual approach and one of the factors that influences the school performance of students. The data set contains 8 columns and 1000 rows. The aim of this data exploration is to get insights on the variables affecting studentâ€™s performances

The Aim of doing this project is to get the valuable and meaningful insight of the major controversy in the Educational research as well as the factors that influences school performance of students.

The Dataset I used was gotten from kaggle, which includes 1000 rows and 8 columns in which the columns were made of:
1.	Gender
2.	Race/ethnicity
3.	Parental level of education
4.	Lunch
5.	Test preparation course 
6.	Math score 
7.	Reading score 
8.	Writing score 

Packages used are:
1.	Pandas
2.	Numpy
3.	Seaborn
4.	Matplotlib


Operations performed were:
1.	Data cleaning 
2.	Checking of outliers 
3.	Univariate analysis 
4.	Multivariate analysis


      Conclusion about the student's performance
From the data analyzed above, it can be deduced that;
1.	There were no empty or null value present in the data set
2.	The parental level of education and race/ethnicity was dropped out
3.	Comparing the scores of the students in math, reading and writing; for math, males had the highest while females had the least, for reading, female had the highest while males had the least, for writing, females had the highest while males had the least. it can also be deduced that the distance between writing scores of the males and females has a distance of 7022 which really shows that the female students really worked/prepared hard in writing than the male students.
4.	The scatter plot shows the relationship in the lunch
In terms of parental level of education, it can be seen that the associate's degree and some college had the best results compared to other parental level of education while those of bachelor's degree and master's degree had the least
Also comparing the test score for math in terms of how they completed and how many didn't, it can be deduced too that the rate of people who completed was definitely low compared to those that didn't.
